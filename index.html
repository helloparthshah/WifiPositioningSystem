          Global positioning system or GPS is commonly used to navigate through
          roads and other open locations. While GPS is good with larger
          distances, it is only able to achieve a limited accuracy in indoor
          spaces. Imagine navigating through a mall or a building using nothing
          but GPS, sound difficult right? Thus, we created Wi-Fi Positioning
          System (WPS) to help you navigate through indoor spaces. WPS relies on
          Wi-Fi signal strengths from close by networks in order to predict your
          location.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            First of all, in order to predict your location, we need to train
            our model with WiFi signal strengths from close by networks. On our
            server, we created a post request that will be invoked few times a
            second. The request will take in SSID, signal strength, and location
            of the client and store it in a JSON file. The requests would look
            something like
            <code
              >{"eduroam": -86, "ucd-guest": -85, "testwifi": -30, "home1": -82,
              "location": "inside"}</code
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            After gathering around 200 points of data over 2 lab sessions, we
            converted the JSON into CSV in order to train it. We used Tensoflow
            to train our model. After training for around 100 epochs, we were
            able to get an accuracy of around 85% on our test data (80-20
            split).

          <p>
            Now that we have trained our model, we can predict your location.
            Since we are using a sigmoid activation function, if the model
            returns a value greater than 0.5, we can assume that you are outside
            and vice versa. We added another endpoint to our server that will
            take in your SSID and signal strength and return your prediction. We
            also created a database that will store the current location of the
            client to show it on our frontend.

          <p>
            Security is a big part of our project since we are dealing with
            sensitive data such as locations and Wi-Fi SSIDs. We used OAuth2 to
            authenticate our users. The client sends the username and password
            in base64 encoding to the /login endpoint. The server validates the
            credentials and returns a JWT token. The client sends the token to
            the other endpoints to ensure that the user is authenticated. The
            passwords are stored using sha256 hashing. The token is only valid
            for 1 hour after which it expires. The user then needs to ask for a
            new token. Since it supports multiple users, we were able to have 2
            devices working at the same time and being able to view their
            locations in real time.

        <div class="card-body">
          <p>
            To create a potential use case for our project, we created a simple
            web app that will show you the current location of the client. We
            also added the ability to create rules in IF THIS THEN THAT format.
            The user can create a rule that will trigger when the client is
            inside and when the client is outside. The user can also create a
            rule that will trigger when the client is in a specific location.
            The user can choose from play/pause on Spotify, email, text, or
            notifying the user.
